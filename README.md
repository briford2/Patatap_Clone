# Patatap Clone
This is an attempt to make a copy of the original <a href="https://patatap.com/">Patatap App</a>. It uses Javascript Audio Library <a href="https://howlerjs.com/">howlerjs</a> for sound (mp3) and <a href="http://paperjs.org/">paperjs</a> to animate the circles.
When alphabet keys are pressed , app reacts by random-colored circles zooming out at random positions on screen with sound feedback.<br>

NOTE : It does not work on mobile devices yet!
